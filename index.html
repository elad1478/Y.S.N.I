        <p class="lead">In recent years the subject of genealogical research has become popular practice in many families. The tools available to
          the amateur researcher in this field are many and enable almost everyone to conduct research regarding unknown
          members of the family and to learn the fate of members of the family from previous generations.</p>
        <p class="lead">However, there is one field of genealogical research that requires great professionality and demands knowledge and
          immense experience; this refers to genealogical research which aims to restore lost assets and to identify those who today
          are entitled to be recognized as the owners.</p>
        <p class="lead">All over the world today there are vast quantities of assets where the owners are unknown or, according to legal definition
          — assets where the owners who are qualified to manage them remain unidentified as owners in practice.</p>

    <div class="row featurette">
      <div class="">
        <p class="h4 px-3 my-3">The definition “lost” assets stems from the fact that the authorities do not know who the owners entitled to the assets are,
          in addition to the fact that those who are entitled to the assets are completely ignorant of their existence.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="row featurette">
      <div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
        <p class="lead">In fact this investigative field of genealogical research is concerned with the legal aspects, the investigator concentrating
          on collecting research material that meets the legal criteria of the laws of evidence as they apply in all the relevant
          countries for the purpose of obtaining legal recognition regarding the identity of the original owner, the merit of his title
          rights as well as the identities of heirs as they hold today.</p>
        <p class="lead">The factor motivating this research are heirs who possess some information regarding the asset owned by an antecedent
          but who have no details concerning said asset, and there are cases where the initiative is triggered by the necessity to
          locate a lost asset in order to trace who holds rights to ownership today.</p>
        <p class="lead">The disconnection between the property and its owners was mainly the result of war, change of regime, emigration as well
          as occurrence of death without children.</p>

        <p class="lead">In Chapter 22 in the Book of Deuteronomy of the Bible, the commandment for restoring lost property consists of two
          parts: </p>
        <p class="lead">the commandment to act: “You shall return the lost" and the commandment that forbids — “you Shall Not
          Ignored ”.
          The second part is more common, and the commentators characterize it as behavior by an individual who “pretends not to
          see”.</p>
        <p class="h4 px-3 my-3">The fact that there are lost assets is the result of various authorities and entities in several countries that find it
          convenient to act as if they cannot see.</p>

        <p class="lead">Attorney Michael Goldstein began his professional career at the start of the 1980s when he was asked by the
          Administrator General and the Official receiver in the Ministry of Justice to coordinate preparation of companies involved
          in the purchase and sale of land in the thirties — for the purpose of liquidation. The difficulty faced by the authorities was
          that contact with thousands of applicants regarding purchase of the land was severed due to the event of the Second
          World War and the economic crisis at that time, and it was necessary to conduct a historical Judicial research in order to
          trace each and every contact for determining whether the heirs of the original caller were today’s creditors of the company
          or whether for one legal reason or another they were not entitled any more to the rights (of course research has to be
          prepared on the basis of the identity of the applicants and their heirs).</p>
        <p class=lead>Further to his activity in the law firm that he founded, Attorney Michael Goldstein continues to deal with cases for
          realizing the rights of heirs to lost assets to which they are entitled, and during the past year he founded the Y.S.N.I.
          Historical-Judicial Research LTD company that deals in this field, in cooperation with genealogical researchers and jurists
          throughout the world.</p>
