    <h2 class="firstHeading text-center">Abandoned Property - What is it?</h2>
    <div>
        <p>According to Israeli law “abandoned property” is defined as a property where “no individual
            has been found who is authorized and capable of practicing as its owner or manager or
            where the owner is unknown” [ General Administrator Law — 1978, section (1)].</p>
        <p>Although this definition applies in Israeli law, it reflects the essence of it being an abandoned
            property according to all legal systems around the world.</p>
        <p>The basis for this definition is found in the ruling that at a legal level, as it is considered an
            abandoned property no one is entitled to manage it according to the practice of an owner
            and as such the owner is “not found” or is “unknown”.</p>
        <p>The status of: “not found” — is applicable for example in a situation where the identity of
            the owner is known but his heirs are unknown.
            The status of: “unknown” — is applicable for example in a situation where the owner
            himself is not identified and/or unknown.</p>
        <p>The second situation is the one that characterizes the majority of cases with which the
            company deals; this is the most complicated situation as the task facing the company is
            twofold — in the first stage to identify the original owner, and in the second stage to locate
            his heirs.</p>
        <p>In the situation where the property is abandoned, it is exposed to harm arising from the fact
            that no one is legally authorized to appear and defend the rights to the property by
            formulated steps, legal proceedings, etc.) and more seriously, the property is exposed to
            attempts by fraudsters to harm or steal the rights to the property, and such instances add a
            complication to the work of the company — i.e., a race against the clock.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the past Advocate Michael Goldstein has been approached by officials from the
                Israel Ministry of Justice who had identified attempts to steal land purchased by
                French citizens several decades ago. The attempt at stealing was carried out using
                notarized documents suspected of being forged but it was not possible to prove this),
                and the only way to thwart this attempt at theft was by means of research work
                carried out by Advocate Michael Goldstein to identify the original holder, locating
                their heirs, conducting legal action for the recognition of rights of the heirs to the
                land and dealing with the legal procedure by means of Advocate Michael Goldstein
                to cancel the attempted theft [legal files — in the Haifa district court — 001194/05
                and 13639-12-09).</li>
            <li>Currently the company is dealing with recognition of rights of heirs to an abandoned
                property in Israel, consisting of a piece of land planned to become a commercial
                center — (and in the framework of allocation of rights to the building of the
                commercial center the absentee owner’s rights to the land were discriminated
                against due to the fact that there was no qualified individual present to appear on
                his behalf.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Taking an example at a criminal level, the abandoned property is the equivalent of an
            individual who has been murdered and cannot be identified, and the work of the company is
            a combination of identifying the murdered individual, a criminal investigation to locate those
            involved, building a legal file, prosecuting and managing the legal process until
            pronouncement of the verdict.</p>
