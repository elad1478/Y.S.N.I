              <p>Attorney Michael Goldstein began his professional career at the start of the 1980s when he was asked by the
                Administrator General and the Official receiver in the Ministry of Justice to coordinate preparation of companies involved
                in the purchase and sale of land in the thirties — for the purpose of liquidation. The difficulty faced by the authorities was
                that contact with thousands of applicants regarding purchase of the land was severed due to the event of the Second
                World War and the economic crisis at that time, and it was necessary to conduct a historical Judicial research in order to
                trace each and every contact for determining whether the heirs of the original contract holder were today’s creditors of the
                company or whether for one legal reason or another they were not entitled any more to the rights (of course research has
                to be prepared on the basis of the identity of the applicants and their heirs).</p> 
                <p>Further to his activity in the law firm that he founded, Attorney Michael Goldstein continues to deal with cases for
                    realizing the rights of heirs to lost assets to which they are entitled, and during the past year he founded the 
                    <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Historical-Judicial Research LTD</span>
                    company that deals in this field, in cooperation with genealogical researchers and jurists

                <p><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Y.S.N.I. Historical-Judicial Research Ltd.</span> manages its work as described above with the assistance
                    of many researchers, each specializing in a specific field and in cooperation with lawyers in different
                    countries. In addition, communication with clients/heirs is carried out directly by the CEO of the
                    company, advocate Michael Goldstein, and he takes responsibility for coordinating the work; this is
                    the uniqueness of the Company.</p>

                  <p>Advocate Michael Goldstein, graduate of the Faculty of Law, the Hebrew University of
                    Jerusalem and licensed to practice law in Israel for more than 35 years, began his
                    professional career as an intern in the law offices of the late advocate Amram Blum who
                    served as Custodian General and Official Receiver of the state of Israel.</p>
                    <p>The file assigned to Michael Goldstein in the Ministry of Justice was — “American Zion
                      Commonwealth Ltd.”. This was a company that at the start of the century dealt with
                      purchase of plots of land in Israel for thousands of Jews who were living in Europe and North
                      America. The company had ceased its operations many years earlier with all that that
                      entailed.</p>
                      <p>The handling of the file involved locating the company’s documents (discovery of a lost
                        archive which contained tens of thousands of files), conducting research to trace and
                        organize the company’s assets, and the thousands of its communications with Jews all over
                        the world for purchasing plots of land in Israel .</p>

                <p>Subsequent to the work carried out over the years and which was led by Advocate Michael
                  Goldstein (who for this purpose acted as special representative of the Official Receiver and
                  Custodian General), all the assets of the company were concentrated (real estate worth over
                  NIS. 150 million) and analysis of the thousands of aforementioned collated communications
                  was performed, it was found that some contacts had land allotted to them, with some
                  communication was cancelled or discontinued and some — about 1,000 in number, were
                  recognized as being entitled to receive rights to the property of the above-mentioned
                  company, and since the fact that a liquidation order was issued against the company —
                  these contacts (the majority of whom are missing) became creditors of the company.</p>
                <p>While carrying out the above work, advocate Michael Goldstein was exposed to all the
                  constituents involved in implementation of genealogical legal research work, both from the
                  legal as well as the research aspects involved, thus acquiring experience and exceptional
                  knowledge in this field.</p>
                <p>At the start of his management of the above files, Advocate Michael Goldstein successfully
                  fought the various authorities who claimed that since the rights in question were acquired
                  many years previously by those who had died many years previously, and their identities and
                  the identities of their heirs were unknown — title rights did not apply anymore; however, in
                  his battle as representative of the Official Receiver and Custodian General — he
                  strengthened recognition of existence of rights to abandoned property that must be
                  protected.</p>
                <p>Throughout his activities described above and later on within the context of his work as a
                  private lawyer as well as within the context of his work in the company he has founded —
                  Advocate Goldstein sees himself on the one hand as one acting on behalf of the company for
                  establishing the rights of missing heirs who left abandoned property and within this
                  framework he is committed to doing whatever is necessary to enable heirs to realize these
                  rights, while on the other hand as an Officer of the court, obliged to be vigilant in
                  connection with all legal procedures regarding the accuracy and authenticity of all
                  documents and information presented in support of proceedings.</p>
                <h5 class="text-center">Examples of activities in favor of bestowing rights to heirs of missing persons</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>In 1988 Advocate Michael Goldstein filed a petition in the Supreme Court in Israel
                      (File 199/88) against a local authority seeking to collect debts in respect of
                      betterment levies claiming to be a secured creditors. Advocate Goldstein claimed
                      that these debts were to be reclaimed in the liquidation proceedings as regular
                      debts [the significance of the authority’s stand was deduction of a sum amounting to
                      millions of shekels from rights that were supposed to be divided between thousands
                      of heirs to missing persons].
                      The petition was accepted and became a legal precedent which is used to this day as
                      the basis for distinguishing between reclaimable debts in liquidation/bankruptcy
                      proceedings and debts owed by secured creditors.</li>
                    <li>In 1998 Advocate Michael Goldstein filed a petition in the Supreme Court [File
                      5660/98] against various state authorities violating the provisions set out by the
                      Custodian General law, thus causing irreparable damage to thousands of heirs to the
                      owners of abandoned properties.
                      At the end of 1999 the petition was discussed and rejected with the claim that the
                      state would find it difficult to act as requested due to difficulties in the computerized
                      systems, or in other words what was then called “Bug 2000”.
                      Needless to say that despite the promises of the authorities and the disappearance
                      of “Bug 2000” as if it never existed, nothing was done.
                      It must be noted that the proceedings were accompanied by an investigative team
                      from a large communications network which was directed to fold up their
                      equipment on the day that the court decision was given.</li>   
                </ul>
                <h5 class="text-center">Example of activity as officer of the court</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>In the year 2017 Advocate Michael Goldstein handled legal proceedings before the
                      Court for Inheritance Issues in Tel Aviv, Israel for issue of an inheritance order
                      following the decease of two missing persons (files 8347-08-17 and 44178-08-17).
                      Advocate Goldstein was not involved in the genealogical research procedures, and
                      the documents used as the basis for the aforesaid application given to him by the
                      alleged heir all carried verification by apostille.
                      At a certain point, after certain suspicion was aroused as to the authenticity of the
                      aforementioned documents (despite their having apostille verification and therefore
                      according to the laws of evidence thought to be genuine documents— based on the
                      international conventions signed by Israel and the country appearing on the
                      apostille signature) — he transferred the main document in the file to a forensic
                      institute, and the <a href="./assets/Forensic examination.pdf" target="_blank" class="font-italic">results of their examination</a> indicated that the document was a
                      forgery, resulting in Advocate Michael Goldstein informing the Court that he is
                      removing himself from processing the application.</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">The files handled by the Company are managed directly and personally by Advocate
                    Michael Goldstein, thus ensuring that their treatment is professional, reliable and
                    dedicated.</p>
