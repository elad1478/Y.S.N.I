            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Advocate Michael Goldstein, graduate of the Faculty of Law, the Hebrew University of
                    Jerusalem and licensed to practice law in Israel for more than 35 years, began his
                    professional career as an intern in the law offices of the late advocate Amram Blum who
                    served as Custodian General and Official Receiver of the state of Israel.</p>
                <p>The file assigned to Michael Goldstein in the Ministry of Justice was — “American Zion
                    Commonwealth Ltd.”. This was a company that at the start of the century dealt with
                    purchase of plots of land in Israel for thousands of Jews who were living in Europe and North
                    America. The company had ceased its operations many years earlier with all that that
                    entailed.</p>
                <p>The handling of the file involved locating the company’s documents (discovery of a lost
                    archive which contained tens of thousands of files), conducting research to trace and
                    organize the company’s assets, and the thousands of its communications with Jews all over
                    the world for purchasing plots of land in Israel .</p>
                <p>Subsequent to the work carried out over the years and which was led by Advocate Michael
                    Goldstein (who for this purpose acted as special representative of the Official Receiver and
                    Custodian General), all the assets of the company were concentrated (real estate worth over
                    NIS. 150 million) and analysis of the thousands of aforementioned collated communications
                    was performed, it was found that some contacts had land allotted to them, with some
                    communication was cancelled or discontinued and some — about 1,000 in number, were
                    recognized as being entitled to receive rights to the property of the above-mentioned
                    company, and since the fact that a liquidation order was issued against the company —
                    these contacts (the majority of whom are missing) became creditors of the company.</p>
                <p>While carrying out the above work, advocate Michael Goldstein was exposed to all the
                    constituents involved in implementation of genealogical legal research work, both from the
                    legal as well as the research aspects involved, thus acquiring experience and exceptional
                    knowledge in this field.</p>
                <p>At the start of his management of the above files, Advocate Michael Goldstein successfully
                    fought the various authorities who claimed that since the rights in question were acquired
                    many years previously by those who had died many years previously, and their identities and
                    the identities of their heirs were unknown — title rights did not apply anymore; however, in
                    his battle as representative of the Official Receiver and Custodian General — he
                    strengthened recognition of existence of rights to abandoned property that must be
                    protected.</p>
                <p>Throughout his activities described above and later on within the context of his work as a
                    private lawyer as well as within the context of his work in the company he has founded —
                    Advocate Goldstein sees himself on the one hand as one acting on behalf of the company for
                    establishing the rights of missing heirs who left abandoned property and within this
                    framework he is committed to doing whatever is necessary to enable heirs to realize these
                    rights, while on the other hand as an Officer of the court, obliged to be vigilant in
                    connection with all legal procedures regarding the accuracy and authenticity of all
                    documents and information presented in support of proceedings.</p>
