    <h2 class="firstHeading text-center responsiveHeading">Legal aspects of geneological resarch</h2>
    <p>The unique legal aspects of the Company’s work relate to five main levels:</p>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>
        <p>The Rights/Assets</p>
        <p>An abandoned property can be an asset where the rights to it are regulated in a register
          [land, shares, etc.], and possibly it can be an asset where ownership is not registered by law
          [art treasures, contractual rights, etc.]</p>
         <p>In cases where the rights to abandoned properties are lawfully registered, there are
          properties where the registration is still in the name of the original owner, and there are
          those properties which are not registered in the name of the original owner [due to
          requisition, nationalization, transfer to the authority handling abandoned properties,
          transfer to a public authority — lawfully or unlawfully, transfer lawfully or unlawfully to a
          private entity, etc.], this being the case regarding possession of said properties which are
          held by anyone, some of which are held by private or public authority , lawfully or
          unlawfully .</p>
         <p>In cases where abandoned properties are not regulated by registration, the main question is
          the identity of the holder, whether lawfully or unlawfully, whether in reference to a private
          holder or public holder [including museums].</p>
         <p>The complexities described above bear great significance regarding the legal aspects of the
          rights [proprietary/contractual], and as a result implications as to legal procedures that are
          possible or worth taking in order to return the rights to the rightful owners — the heirs to
          the original purchaser of the rights.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>The company also deals with obtaining compensation in cases where rights have
                  been misappropriated by municipal and state authorities.</li>
              <li>The company also handles restoration of property where ownership has been
                  transferred to the Commissioner for Enemy Property in Israel (during the Second
                  World War all countries occupied by Germany and its allies were defined by the
                  mandatory government as enemy states, and the property acquired in Israel by Jews
                  from these countries was designated enemy property].</li>
              <li>The company also handles release of property under the management of the
                  Custodian General in Israel.</li>
              <li>The Company also handles rights to properties that have undergone nationalization
                  in east European countries.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The original owner of rights</p>
        <p>The abandoned assets with which the Company deals are properties to which rights were
          acquired many decades ago, and sometimes even before that.</p>
        <p>Identification of owners based on data dating back decades, is complex and extremely
          complicated; in most cases registration at that time was made without any means of
          identification and even if it exists, the data is not of any help today (i.e., passport number
          from decades ago). In many countries at that time (and in some cases also today) people
          were identified on the basis of their parents’ names (such as death certificates issued in
          European countries).</p>
        <p>Due to the passage of time, and especially when it came to Jews living in east and central
          Europe, their signatures were in Hebrew lettering (or Yiddish), and later on when they
          emigrated to other countries they signed in Latin/Cyrillic lettering and others.</p>
        <p>At that time acquisition of land at in Eretz Israel was done by Jews all over the world by
          means of various Powers of Attorney, by community messengers (and even via the
          synagogue treasurer), and this situation complicates arriving at identification and proof
          thereof.</p>
        <p>The events of the wars in Europe led to the destruction of some of the municipal and
          government archives which are important genealogically and as a source of evidence for
          identifying those who purchased rights.</p>
        <p>The process for proving deaths of Jews who perished in the Holocaust is also complex.</p>
        <p>There are cases where the authorities have some information regarding the holder [and it is
          possible to cross-reference the information with research findings by the Company) but
          there are cases where the authority’s file is empty and proof of identity is extremely hard
          [since it is rare to find heirs who possess original documents directly relating to the process
          of purchase of rights by their legator who died many years beforehand].</p>
        <p>The procedure for identification is the most complicated procedure in the work of the
          Company and demands experience and extensive knowledge in many fields — both in
          research/genealogy as well as legally.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>The heirs to the owner of rights</p>
          <p>Once the original owner of rights has been identified, his heirs have to be located [usually
            they are located in various countries.</p>
         <p>In most cases the heirs today are the grandchildren and/or great-grandchildren of the
            original purchaser of the rights, and in cases where the original owner of rights has no
            descendants, the heirs today are the grandchildren and/or great-grandchildren of the
            brothers or sisters of the original owner of rights, or even his cousins.</p>
         <p>In addition to the above intricacy, there are cases where it is necessary to get to the chain of
            descendants of the spouse of the original owner of rights.</p>
         <p>Of course it is also necessary to check whether the original holder of rights and/or his
            deceased heirs have left a Will.</p>
         <p>In most cases the family/heirs are unaware of the existence of the property and their rights
            to it and in the majority of cases they are unfamiliar with the relevant family composition,
            and they learn about this from the research findings of the Company. For this reason in
            many cases it is not possible to produce evidence as to the family composition based on
            affidavits by family members.</p>
         <p>[Of course there are instances where the family/heirs are acquainted with partial
            information].</p>
         <p>The genealogical information currently found on various internet sites is vast, and it would
            appear to facilitate the work of creating a family genealogical tree; however, a large part of
            this information is not precise [based on information that is not first hand, such as stories
            told between family members, etc.] and in any case this information in itself cannot be used
            as evidentiary basis in a legal proceeding, and therefore most of the material found on
            internet sites are only a tool for the legal genealogist and not as evidentiary material.</p>
         <p>The legal procedure for recognition of the heirs to the original owner of the rights (a process
            that sometimes requires issue of several Probate Orders and/or Proofs of Will) must be
            carried out in the country where the property is situated.</p>
         <p>In this regard it is important to note that Inheritance Orders and Proof of Will are in
            themselves declarations acts, and therefore according to the rules of law in all legal systems
            there is no possibility of enforcing such an Order in another country [enforcement of foreign
            judgements are possible if and only when it comes to obligatory judgements].</p>
         <p>Bottom line — the procedures for location of heirs and legal recognition of their status are
            exceedingly complicated.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Taxation</p>
        <p>The aspects of taxation touch on to two facets of the Company’s work.</p>
               <p>The first — estate tax that is applied in many countries.</p>
               <p>The second — tax on the profit resulting from realization of the estate after recognition of
                the status and rights of the heirs.</p>
               <p>In cases handled by the Company, dealing with taxation in the above context is complex as it
                concerns different countries (location of property, place of residence of the original
                purchaser, place of residence of the heirs, and more) as well as different periods of time
                (date of purchase, many dates of inheritance and date of realization of the estate).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Private International Law</p>
        <p>One of the most fascinating and complex fields in the legal world — the private international
          law that deals with legal situations which combine foreign law and a country having to grant
          legal relief.</p>
         <p>In cases handled by the Company the foreign law performs on two levels:</p>
         <p>The first: the authority authorized to give the judicial decision regarding settlement of the
          estate of the original owner of the rights and of his deceased heirs, is required to take into
          account the regulations pertaining under private international laws, according to the last
          place of residence of the purchaser of rights as well as the local laws pertaining in the place
          of residence of his deceased heirs.</p>
         <p>The second: When the basis of rights is a legal document — contract, trusteeship,
          endowment, etc., in many cases this necessitates foreign law in the place where the
          contractual obligation was formed and the place of residence of the signatories.</p>
         <p>In addition to the international aspects of the files handled by the Company, there are also
          consequences regarding taxation as well as the rules governing the laws of evidence when
          using foreign documents required for legal proceedings.</p>
