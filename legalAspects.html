      <h2 class="firstHeading text-center responsiveHeading">Legal aspects of genealogical resarch</h2>
    <p>The unique legal aspects of the Company’s work relate to five main levels:</p>
      <div>    
         <div class="row">   
        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <ol type="I">
            <li>
              <p>The Rights/Assets</p>
              <p>An abandoned property can be an asset where the rights to it are regulated in a register
                [land, shares, etc.], and possibly it can be an asset where ownership is not registered by law
                [art treasures, contractual rights, etc.]</p>
               <p>In cases where the rights to abandoned properties are lawfully registered, there are
                properties where the registration is still in the name of the original owner, and there are
                those properties which are not registered in the name of the original owner [due to
                requisition, nationalization, transfer to the authority handling abandoned properties,
                transfer to a public authority — lawfully or unlawfully, transfer lawfully or unlawfully to a
                private entity, etc.], this being the case regarding possession of said properties which are
                held by anyone, some of which are held by private or public authority , lawfully or
                unlawfully .</p>
               <p>In cases where abandoned properties are not regulated by registration, the main question is
                the identity of the holder, whether lawfully or unlawfully, whether in reference to a private
                holder or public holder [including museums].</p>
               <p>The complexities described above bear great significance regarding the legal aspects of the
                rights [proprietary/contractual], and as a result implications as to legal procedures that are
                possible or worth taking in order to return the rights to the rightful owners — the heirs to
                the original purchaser of the rights.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The company also deals with obtaining compensation in cases where rights have
                      been misappropriated by municipal and state authorities.</li>
                    <li>The company also handles restoration of property where ownership has been
                      transferred to the Commissioner for Enemy Property in Israel (during the Second
                      World War all countries occupied by Germany and its allies were defined by the
                      mandatory government as enemy states, and the property acquired in Israel by Jews
                      from these countries was designated enemy property].</li>
                    <li>TThe company also handles release of property under the management of the
                      Custodian General in Israel.</li>
                    <li>The Company also handles rights to properties that have undergone nationalization
                      in east European countries.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <div  class="card mobile-card d-lg-none"  >
              <img src="./assets/Legal aspects/Document approval by Surrogate's court N.Y.jpg" class="card-img-top " alt="...">
              <div class="card-body ">
                <p class="card-text">Document approval by Surrogate's court N.Y </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <li>
              <p>The original owner of rights</p>
              <p>The abandoned assets with which the Company deals are properties to which rights were
                acquired many decades ago, and sometimes even before that.</p>
              <p>Identification of owners based on data dating back decades, is complex and extremely
                complicated; in most cases registration at that time was made without any means of
                identification and even if it exists, the data is not of any help today (i.e., passport number
                from decades ago). In many countries at that time (and in some cases also today) people
                were identified on the basis of their parents’ names (such as death certificates issued in
                European countries).</p>
              <p>Due to the passage of time, and especially when it came to Jews living in east and central
                Europe, their signatures were in Hebrew lettering (or Yiddish), and later on when they
                emigrated to other countries they signed in Latin/Cyrillic lettering and others.</p>
              <p>At that time acquisition of land at in Eretz Israel was done by Jews all over the world by
                means of various Powers of Attorney, by community messengers (and even via the
                synagogue treasurer), and this situation complicates arriving at identification and proof
                thereof.</p>
              <p>The events of the wars in Europe led to the destruction of some of the municipal and
                government archives which are important genealogically and as a source of evidence for
                identifying those who purchased rights.</p>
              <p>The process for proving deaths of Jews who perished in the Holocaust is also complex.</p>
              <p>There are cases where the authorities have some information regarding the holder [and it is
                possible to crossreference the information with research findings by the Company) but there
                are cases where the authority’s file is empty and proof of identity is extremely hard [since it
                is rare to find heirs who possess original documents directly relating to the process of
                purchase of rights by their legator who died many years beforehand].</p>
              <p>The procedure for identification is the most complicated procedure in the work of the
                Company and demands experience and extensive knowledge in many fields — both in
                research/genealogy as well as legally.</p>

            <div class="card-body ">
              <p class="card-text">Document approval by Apostil </p>

          </div>
          <li>
            <p>The heirs to the owner of rights</p>
            <p>Once the original owner of rights has been identified, his heirs have to be located [usually
              they are located in various countries.</p>
           <p>In most cases the family/heirs are unaware of the existence of the property and their rights
            to it and in the majority of cases they are unfamiliar with the relevant family composition,
            and they learn about this from the research findings of the Company. For this reason in
            many cases it is not possible to produce evidence as to the family composition based on
            affidavits by family members.</p>
           <p>In addition to the above intricacy, there are cases where it is necessary to get to the chain of
            descendants of the spouse of the original owner of rights.</p>
           <p>Of course it is also necessary to check whether the original holder of rights and/or his
            deceased heirs have left a Will.</p>
           <p>In most cases the family/heirs are unaware of the existence of the property and their rights
              to it and in the majority of cases they are unfamiliar with the relevant family composition,
              and they learn about this from the research findings of the Company. For this reason in
              many cases it is not possible to produce evidence as to the family composition based on
              affidavits by family members.</p>
           <p>[Of course there are instances where the family/heirs are acquainted with partial
              information].</p>
           <p>The genealogical information currently found on various internet sites is vast, and it would
            appear to facilitate the work of creating a family genealogical tree; however, a large part of
            this information is not precise [based on information that is not first hand, such as stories
            told between family members, etc.] and in any case this information in itself cannot be used
            as evidentiary basis in a legal proceeding, and therefore most of the material found on
            internet sites are only a tool for the legal genealogist and not as evidentiary material.</p>
           <p>The legal procedure for recognition of the heirs to the original owner of the rights (a process
            that sometimes requires issue of several Probate Orders and/or Proofs of Will) must be
            carried out in the country where the property is situated.</p>
           <p>In this regard it is important to note that Inheritance Orders and Proof of Will are in
            themselves declarations acts, and therefore according to the rules of law in all legal systems
            there is no possibility of enforcing such an Order in another country [enforcement of foreign
            judgments are possible if and only when it comes to obligatory judgments].</p>
           <p>Bottom line — the procedures for location of heirs and legal recognition of their status are
            exceedingly complicated.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Taxation</p>
                <p>The aspects of taxation touch on to two facets of the Company’s work.</p>
                       <p>The first — estate tax that is applied in many countries.</p>
                       <p>The second — tax on the profit resulting from realization of the estate after recognition of
                        the status and rights of the heirs.</p>
                       <p>In cases handled by the Company, dealing with taxation in the above context is complex as it
                        concerns different countries (location of property, place of residence of the original
                        purchaser, place of residence of the heirs, and more) as well as different periods of time
                        (date of purchase, many dates of inheritance and date of realization of the estate).</p>

          <li>
            <p>Private International Law</p>
            <p>One of the most fascinating and complex fields in the legal world — the private international
              law that deals with legal situations which combine foreign law and a country having to grant
              legal relief.</p>
             <p>In cases handled by the Company the foreign law performs on two levels:</p>
             <p>The first: the authority authorized to give the judicial decision regarding settlement of the
              estate of the original owner of the rights and of his deceased heirs, is required to take into
              account the regulations pertaining under private international laws, according to the last
              place of residence of the purchaser of rights as well as the local laws pertaining in the place
              of residence of his deceased heirs.</p>
             <p>The second: When the basis of rights is a legal document — contract, trusteeship,
              endowment, etc., in many cases this necessitates foreign law in the place where the
              contractual obligation was formed and the place of residence of the signatories.</p>
             <p>In addition to the international aspects of the files handled by the Company, there are also
              consequences regarding taxation as well as the rules governing the laws of evidence when
              using foreign documents required for legal proceedings.</p>
